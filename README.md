# ZohoHorrorShow

![](https://travis-ci.org/Xymist/zohohorrorshow.svg?branch=master)

A library for interacting with the Zoho Projects API, because it's an awful
nightmare of ambiguous fields, optional fields, random casing and entirely
absent documentation.

Work in progress:

- Finish implementing all GET and POST urls
- Consistently wrap inconsistent fields (no numeric strings!)
- Make sure everything that might be nil is wrapped in an Option
